## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Technical Implementation

**Q: How did you structure this React application?**
- "I used a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility - Header handles navigation, PlaceCard manages individual place display and interactions, CategoryFilters handles filtering logic. I used TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and better developer experience."

**Q: How did you handle state management?**
- "I used React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for local component state. The main filtering state is managed in the Index component and passed down as props. For a larger app, I'd consider React Context or a state management library like Zustand."

**Q: How did you ensure responsive design?**
- "I used Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach. Grid layouts automatically adjust from 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop. The navigation transforms to a hamburger menu on mobile, and I used responsive text sizing and spacing throughout."

### Problem-Solving Approach

**Q: What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?**
- "One challenge was creating smooth card expansion animations. I solved this using CSS transitions and conditional rendering with animation classes. Another was the auto-sliding carousel - I used useEffect with setInterval and proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks."

**Q: How did you optimize performance?**
- "I used React's built-in optimizations like proper key props in lists, avoided unnecessary re-renders by keeping state close to where it's used, and used CSS transforms for animations instead of layout properties. Images are lazy-loaded and properly sized."

### Design Decisions

**Q: Why did you choose this technology stack?**
- "React with TypeScript provides excellent developer experience and type safety. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development while maintaining consistency. Vite offers fast development builds. Shadcn/UI provides accessible, customizable components that match modern design standards."

**Q: How did you ensure accessibility?**
- "I used semantic HTML elements, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support through Shadcn components, sufficient color contrast ratios, and proper focus management. The mobile menu is fully keyboard navigable."

### Code Quality

**Q: How did you organize your code for maintainability?**
- "I separated concerns into logical folders - components, types, data, and utilities. Each component is in its own file with clear interfaces. I used consistent naming conventions and added console.log statements for debugging. TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency."
